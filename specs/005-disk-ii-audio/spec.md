# Feature Specification: Disk II Audio

**Feature Branch**: `feature/005-disk-ii-audio`
**Created**: 2026-03-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Emit realistic mechanical sounds during Disk II activity in the Casso //e emulator: motor hum (continuous while motor is on), head-step click (per quarter-track phase change), track-0 bump/thunk (head pinned at travel stop while stepper still energized), and door open/close (disk insert/eject). Mix into the existing WASAPI audio pipeline alongside the //e speaker output, with stereo placement reflecting physical drive position (Drive 1 left, Drive 2 right). Must not regress speaker audio. Options dialog toggle to enable/disable drive audio independently (defaults to on). Real-hardware sample recordings are preferred when permissively licensed; procedural synthesis is acceptable fallback. The plumbing must be sufficiently abstracted that other drive types (//c internal 5.25, DuoDisk, Apple /// drive, ProFile hard disk) can be wired in trivially in future features, and that the same Disk II audio works in any machine profile that hosts a Disk II controller (][, ][+, //e)."

**Reference research**: [`research.md`](./research.md) — source-verified survey of disk-audio implementations in OpenEmulator/libemulation, MAME, and AppleWin, plus the Casso-specific architectural sketch this spec is grounded in.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Hear the disk drive boot a DOS 3.3 image (Priority: P1)

A retro-computing user mounts a stock DOS 3.3 disk image in Drive 1 of an emulated //e and cold-boots. From the moment the disk controller spins the drive, the user hears (alongside the //e speaker beep) the unmistakable Disk II soundscape: a low-frequency motor hum that comes up shortly after PR#6, a flurry of mechanical clicks while the head re-calibrates to track 0 (including audible "thunk" sounds when the head hits the track-0 stop), and a settled motor hum that persists through the load and across brief inter-sector motor-off windows without stuttering.

**Why this priority**: This is the entire feature's reason to exist. If a DOS 3.3 boot doesn't *sound* like a Disk II, the feature has failed. It exercises every audio code path — motor on, motor spindown, single steps, seek bursts, and track-0 bumps — in a single 5-second sequence on real software.

**Independent Test**: Boot a DOS 3.3 fixture disk in the //e profile and listen / capture the host audio stream. Verify the speaker emits its boot beep AND the motor hum + head-click + bump cluster fires during the DOS RWTS recalibration. Verify the motor hum does **not** drop out during the brief $C0E8/$C0E9 motor-off/on toggles that DOS issues between inter-track sector reads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a //e with a DOS 3.3 disk image in Drive 1 and disk audio enabled, **When** the user cold-boots, **Then** the motor hum begins audibly within ~50ms of the first `$C0E9` strobe, and persists continuously across DOS's mid-load $C0E8/$C0E9 cycles until ~1 second after the final motor-off.
2. **Given** the same boot, **When** DOS's RWTS recalibrates the head to track 0, **Then** the user hears a burst of head-step clicks ending in at least one distinct, lower-pitched bump sound (the head being pinned at the travel stop while the stepper is still energized).
3. **Given** the //e speaker is also active (e.g., the boot beep), **When** both speaker and disk audio play simultaneously, **Then** neither pipeline drops samples, glitches, or distorts beyond the sum of their independent amplitudes (no buffer underruns, no clicks introduced by mixing).

---

### User Story 2 - Toggle drive audio independently of speaker (Priority: P2)

A user finds the drive sounds distracting during long sessions and disables them via **View → Options... → Drive Audio**. The //e speaker continues to function normally. The user can re-enable drive audio at any time without restarting the emulator, and the setting reflects the current state in the dialog (checked / unchecked). Drive audio is **on by default** for a first-launch user.

**Why this priority**: Without an off switch, the feature is unshippable — drive audio is character-rich but also unrelenting during heavy disk activity. Independent of speaker volume because the speaker is application-essential and drive audio is decorative.

**Independent Test**: Launch the emulator, open **View → Options...**, verify "Drive Audio" is checked by default; mount a disk and confirm drive sounds. Uncheck the toggle and apply; verify drive sounds stop immediately while a speaker tone (e.g., from BASIC `PRINT CHR$(7)`) remains audible. Re-check; verify drive sounds resume on the next disk activity. Restart the emulator; verify the last-set state persists if a settings-persistence mechanism exists, otherwise verify it returns to default-on.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh launch with no saved settings, **When** the user opens **View → Options...**, **Then** the dialog includes a "Drive Audio" checkbox and it is checked.
2. **Given** drive audio is enabled and a disk is actively seeking, **When** the user unchecks "Drive Audio" and applies, **Then** drive sounds cease within one audio frame and the //e speaker remains audible.
3. **Given** drive audio is disabled, **When** the user re-checks "Drive Audio" mid-session, **Then** subsequent disk activity produces audio without requiring a reboot or disk remount.

---

### User Story 3 - Run without sample assets present (Priority: P3)

A developer pulls the repo with no audio asset files staged (or with the asset directory missing on disk). The emulator launches, boots, and runs disk-based software end-to-end. No crash, no error popup, no message-box interruption. Drive audio is silently inactive; everything else — including the //e speaker and the **View → Options... → Drive Audio** toggle — continues to work.

**Why this priority**: A retro emulator must never refuse to start over a decorative subsystem. This is the contract that lets sample sourcing be deferred without blocking the rest of the feature. Lower priority than the toggle because the developer's workaround (procedural synthesis at implementation time, or simply landing the wiring without samples) is cheap.

**Independent Test**: Delete the `Assets/Sounds/DiskII/` directory (or rename it). Launch the emulator, boot a disk fixture, and confirm: process does not crash, no modal popup appears, logs show at most a single non-fatal warning per missing sample, the **View → Options... → Drive Audio** toggle still works (it just toggles a no-op), and the speaker pipeline is unaffected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `Assets/Sounds/DiskII/` does not exist, **When** the emulator launches, **Then** the process reaches the main window without prompting the user and the //e cold-boots normally.
2. **Given** the asset directory exists but `HeadStep.wav` is missing, **When** the head steps, **Then** no audible step click is produced but the motor hum (whose sample is present) continues normally.
3. **Given** any missing-asset condition, **When** the user toggles **View → Options... → Drive Audio**, **Then** the toggle succeeds without error.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Spindown mid-toggle**: User disables drive audio while the motor is in the ~1-second spindown window. The motor hum must stop immediately, not finish out its spindown buffer.
- **Rapid step bursts (DOS 3.3 boot)**: Four-plus head-step events arrive within ~16ms of each other. Behavior must collapse into a single continuous seek-rate audio gesture, not four overlapping one-shots stacking on each other and clipping the mix.
- **Track-0 wall-banging**: DOS 3.3 RWTS recalibration steps "inward" past track 0 multiple times. Each attempt that re-energizes phase 0 while `m_quarterTrack == 0` must produce a bump sound, and consecutive bumps must not stack into one continuous bump tone.
- **Drive audio sample length vs. event cadence**: A head-step sample (~50–150ms) may still be playing when the next step arrives. The mixer must transition into continuous-seek mode rather than restarting the one-shot from sample-position zero on every step (otherwise rapid seeks become a perceived "click-click-click" loop instead of a buzz).
- **Concurrent speaker amplitude**: Speaker output at full deflection (~±0.5) plus motor hum (~0.25) plus a head-click peak (~0.30) can summed exceed 1.0. Mixer must either clamp to the float PCM range without introducing audible artifacts, or scale to leave headroom.
- **Two-drive simultaneous motor**: Casso supports two Disk II drives. When both drives' motors are on simultaneously, both motor loops play independently with their per-drive equal-power pan (FR-008). The combined per-channel amplitude is bounded by the panning and the phase-incoherence of the two motor streams; no explicit dedup is applied. Head-step, bump, and door events fire per-drive with per-drive stereo placement.
- **Door event during active load**: User ejects/inserts a disk while the motor is spinning and the head is seeking. Door open/close sounds must mix additively with motor and head sounds without dropping samples or muting either.
- **Save/restore mid-spindown**: Out of scope for this feature — Casso has no save-state subsystem to break here.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 (Motor hum looping)**: While the Disk II controller's `m_motorOn` flag is true, the disk audio subsystem MUST emit a seamlessly looping motor-hum signal. The signal MUST be driven by the post-spindown-timer `m_motorOn` flag, not by the raw `$C0E8`/`$C0E9` soft-switch events, so that brief inter-sector motor-off/on cycles do **not** cause the hum to drop out.
- **FR-002 (Motor fade-out on spindown)**: When `m_motorOn` transitions from true to false (i.e., after the ~1-second spindown timer expires inside `DiskIIController::Tick()`), the motor hum MUST fade out cleanly (either via the natural tail of a windrun sample or a short envelope), with no audible click at the cut point.
- **FR-003 (Head-step click — actual movement only)**: A head-step click MUST fire exactly once per `HandlePhase()` invocation where `qtDelta != 0`, i.e., where the head actually moved a quarter-track. Soft-switch accesses that do not displace the head (e.g., energizing an already-active phase) MUST NOT produce a step sound.
- **FR-004 (Track-0 bump)**: When a phase change would move the head past `m_quarterTrack == 0` (and the head is clamped to 0), the audio subsystem MUST emit a distinct bump/thunk sound (separate from the ordinary head-step click). The same MUST hold at the upper travel stop (`m_quarterTrack == kMaxQuarterTrack`). Bump events MUST NOT also fire a regular step click for the same event.
- **FR-005 (Step-vs-seek discrimination)**: When multiple step events fire within ~16ms of one another (consistent with DOS 3.3 RWTS seek cadence: ≈6–20ms inter-step), the audio subsystem MUST emit a continuous seek-rate audio gesture rather than re-triggering N overlapping one-shot clicks. The discriminator MUST use either MAME's playback-position heuristic ("is the previous step sample still playing?") or OpenEmulator's cycle-gap timer (≈16,368 CPU cycles at 1.023 MHz), at the implementer's discretion. The threshold MUST be at least 16 ms; the exact value MAY be tuned during implementation.
- **FR-006 (Options dialog toggle, default on)**: A "Drive Audio" check toggle MUST appear in the **View → Options...** dialog (creating that dialog as part of this feature if it does not yet exist). The toggle MUST be checked (enabled) by default on first launch. Toggling MUST take effect within one audio frame — no restart, no disk remount required.
- **FR-007 (Independent of speaker)**: The "Drive Audio" toggle MUST act only on drive audio. Disabling drive audio MUST NOT affect speaker output (amplitude, latency, or otherwise), and disabling/muting the speaker (when such control exists) MUST NOT silence drive audio.
- **FR-008 (Multi-drive behavior)**: When multiple drives are present in the machine configuration, each drive's audio source plays its motor hum, head sounds, and door sounds independently with its own equal-power pan (FR-012). Linear amplitude summation is used; the spec explicitly does NOT dedup or suppress motor contributions when both drives are spinning. Rationale: two physical drive motors are phase-incoherent and sum closer to +3 dB (power sum, ≈ 1.41× amplitude) than +6 dB (linear sum, 2×); combined with per-drive panning, the worst-case per-channel peak of two simultaneously-spinning drives is bounded to approximately the same as a single centered drive at full motor. Head-step, bump, and door sounds fire per-drive with per-drive pan.
- **FR-009 (Graceful asset absence)**: If any sample asset file is missing, malformed, fails to decode, or fails to resample at startup, the emulator MUST log a single non-fatal warning per affected asset and continue running. The affected sound (and only the affected sound) MUST be silently omitted. No modal error dialog, no crash, no popup. Other drive audio sounds whose samples loaded successfully MUST continue to function. Asset native sample rate is irrelevant — assets are resampled at load time to the WASAPI device rate (see A-001).
- **FR-010 (Stereo mixing into existing WASAPI pipeline)**: The drive PCM stream MUST be mixed additively into the same per-frame float-PCM buffer that the speaker pipeline already produces inside `WasapiAudio::SubmitFrame()`. The pipeline MUST produce stereo output (left/right interleaved float32) when the WASAPI mix format supports it; when the device is mono, the stereo output MUST be downmixed to mono with no audible amplitude jump. The combined buffer MUST be clamped or scaled to the `[-1.0, +1.0]` range per channel without introducing audible distortion in the speaker signal. Drive audio MUST NOT spawn a second WASAPI render client.
- **FR-011 (No speaker regression)**: The speaker audio pipeline — including `AudioGenerator::GeneratePCM()` output amplitude, latency, and the queued/pending sample queue's drain behavior — MUST be functionally unchanged by the introduction of drive audio. Speaker-only tests MUST pass identically before and after. The speaker MUST be placed at stereo center (equal contribution to left and right channels).
- **FR-012 (Stereo drive placement)**: Each registered drive MUST have a stereo pan coefficient. Pan activates only when **two or more drives** are registered with the mixer. With a single registered drive (the typical //e configuration), that drive plays centered (L = R = √0.5 ≈ 0.707), matching the speaker. With two or more drives, panning uses **equal-power (constant-loudness)** panning: each drive's angle θ from center is computed once at `SetPan`, with coefficients `panL = cos(θ)`, `panR = sin(θ)` (θ measured from the right speaker — i.e., θ = π/4 = center, θ → π/2 = hard left, θ → 0 = hard right). Drive 1 defaults to a position halfway between the left speaker and center (θ ≈ 3π/8 ≈ 67.5°, giving panL ≈ 0.924, panR ≈ 0.383). Drive 2 defaults to the mirror image (θ ≈ π/8 ≈ 22.5°, giving panL ≈ 0.383, panR ≈ 0.924). The rationale: matches a typical physical setup where two Disk II drives sit on top of the //e, placing each drive's perceived source roughly halfway between the corresponding speaker and the //e's center. Pan magnitude is tunable via a single named constant. Pan is applied per-drive to all of that drive's sounds (motor, step, bump, door). Speaker is centered (L = R = √0.5).
- **FR-013 (Disk insert sound)**: When a disk image is mounted on a drive via a **user-initiated, mid-session** action (UI mount, programmatic swap during emulation), that drive's audio source MUST emit a disk-insert / door-close sound exactly once. Mounting onto an already-mounted drive (swap) MUST emit eject (FR-014) followed by insert. **Exception**: cold-boot mounts — i.e., disks mounted as part of emulator startup before the user has interacted with the running //e (command-line arguments, last-session restoration, autoload) — MUST NOT fire an insert sound. Rationale: the disk is treated as "already in the drive when the //e powered on," matching physical reality and avoiding a jarring sound at app launch.
- **FR-014 (Disk eject sound)**: When a disk image is unmounted from a drive (UI eject action or programmatic unload), that drive's audio source MUST emit a disk-eject / door-open sound exactly once.
- **FR-015 (Machine-agnostic wiring)**: Drive audio wiring MUST be keyed off device presence in `MachineConfig`, not off machine model. A Disk II controller plugged into a ][, ][+, //e, or any future Apple II profile MUST receive identical drive-audio behavior. Profiles with zero Disk II controllers MUST incur zero drive-audio overhead (no mixer allocation beyond the inert object, no sink registration).
- **FR-016 (Generic drive audio abstraction)**: The drive-audio interface (`IDriveAudioSink`, the audio-source plumbing it feeds, and the mixer's source-registration API) MUST be sufficiently generic that future drive types — //c internal 5.25, DuoDisk, Apple 5.25 Drive (A9M0107), Apple /// drive, ProFile hard disk, etc. — can be added without modifying the mixer or sink interface. The set of sink events (motor on/off, head step, head bump, disk insert, disk eject) is the minimum supported event vocabulary; drive types that don't use a given event simply never fire it. Concrete sample sets and synthesis are drive-type-specific (left to follow-up features).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (No buffer underruns)**: Drive-audio mixing happens inside the same `SubmitFrame()` call that already drains the WASAPI render client. Mixing MUST add no measurable risk of buffer underruns or audio glitches.
- **NFR-002 (Same-thread state model, v1)**: For v1, all drive-audio state (motor flags, sample positions, last-step cycle counter, per-drive pan) is mutated and read from the CPU-emulation thread (`ExecuteCpuSlices()`), eliminating cross-thread synchronization. The v1 design MUST NOT introduce locks, atomics, or message queues for drive audio. Rationale: v1 mixing is bounded to a few float multiply-adds per active source per frame; the cost does not justify a thread, and a thread would introduce cross-thread state and would still rely on WASAPI's own internal render thread for actual playback. If a future feature introduces expensive DSP (FFT convolution, real-time pitch-shifting, etc.), this NFR is the explicit revisit point.
- **NFR-003 (Asset footprint, advisory)**: Sample assets are expected to be small (well-looped clips, short one-shots). No hard cap is set; pick what sounds right and the size will follow. If the bundled set drifts into ranges that affect installer size noticeably (sustained > ~1 MB compressed), revisit packaging.
- **NFR-004 (License hygiene)**: Bundled sample assets MUST be either self-recorded, procedurally synthesized, or sourced from a permissive (MIT/CC0/CC-BY) license. Real Disk II hardware recordings under such a license are preferred over synthesis when available. OpenEmulator's GPL-3 Alps/Shugart samples MAY be used during development but MUST NOT be committed to `master` (see `research.md` §3.1 — viral copyleft incompatibility).
- **NFR-005 (Sample authenticity preference)**: When sourcing samples, clean recordings of an actual Disk II drive (or the drive type being modeled, for future drive features) MUST be preferred over synthesis. Procedural synthesis is an acceptable fallback; when used, it MUST aim for mechanical realism, not synthetic / "video-game" character.

### Key Entities

- **DriveAudioMixer** — the new subsystem that owns a collection of registered `IDriveAudioSource` instances and produces stereo PCM into a host-supplied buffer per audio frame. It is the sole consumer of all drive audio sources for a machine. Mono-device downmix is its responsibility.
- **IDriveAudioSink** — the abstract sink interface that a drive controller (Disk II today; //c internal floppy, ProFile, etc. in future features) notifies on motor, head, and door events. Decouples the controller from the concrete audio source. Method set: `OnMotorStart`, `OnMotorStop`, `OnHeadStep(int newQt)`, `OnHeadBump()`, `OnDiskInserted()`, `OnDiskEjected()`. Drive types that don't use a given event simply never fire it.
- **IDriveAudioSource** — abstract drive-specific audio source. Owns the sample set (or synthesis state) for one physical drive instance, plus its pan coefficient and play state. Implements `IDriveAudioSink` for incoming events and produces stereo PCM on demand. The mixer iterates over registered sources each frame.
- **DiskIIAudioSource** — concrete `IDriveAudioSource` for the Disk II drive. Owns Disk II sample buffers (`MotorLoop`, `HeadStep`, `HeadStop`, `DoorOpen`, `DoorClose`) and the Disk II-specific seek/step discriminator. Future drive types (e.g., `AppleIIcInternalDriveAudioSource`, `ProFileAudioSource`) live alongside it without modifying the mixer or sink interface.
- **Drive Audio asset set (Disk II v1)** — five logical samples: `MotorLoop`, `HeadStep`, `HeadStop`, `DoorOpen`, `DoorClose`. Stored either as bundled WAV files under `Assets/Sounds/DiskII/` (PascalCase filenames: `MotorLoop.wav`, `HeadStep.wav`, `HeadStop.wav`, `DoorOpen.wav`, `DoorClose.wav`), or generated procedurally inside `DiskIIAudioSource` at startup. Per NFR-005, real-hardware recordings are preferred.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: When a DOS 3.3 disk image is cold-booted with drive audio enabled, a listener can identify (without being told) that they are hearing a 5.25" floppy drive, distinct from the speaker beep. (Validated by informal listening test against a known-good recording of real Disk II hardware.)
- **SC-002**: Mounting a disk and triggering the //e speaker (e.g., a BASIC `PRINT CHR$(7)`) simultaneously produces both sounds without underrun, glitch, or speaker-tone degradation. Measured by zero buffer-underrun events reported by WASAPI over a 60-second mixed-activity run.
- **SC-003**: Toggling **View → Options... → Drive Audio** off and on five consecutive times during active disk activity completes without crash, without orphaned audio (sound persisting after toggle-off), and without delay greater than ~50 ms perceived by the user.
- **SC-004**: Deleting `Assets/Sounds/DiskII/` and launching the emulator results in a successful boot to the //e BASIC prompt with at most one warning log line per missing sample and zero modal dialogs.
- **SC-005**: A DOS 3.3 boot with rapid recalibration sequences produces an audibly-continuous seek/buzz sound rather than a discrete click-click-click train (verified against the FR-005 ~16 ms discrimination threshold).
- **SC-006**: Existing speaker-only unit tests and integration tests pass identically (same outputs, same timings) before and after the drive-audio subsystem is introduced. Zero speaker regressions.
- **SC-007**: In a 2-drive //e profile with sounds enabled, Drive 1 activity is audibly weighted toward the left channel and Drive 2 toward the right channel; speaker output remains centered. Verified by stereo waveform inspection of captured output.
- **SC-008**: Mounting and ejecting a disk produces audible insert and eject sounds respectively, mixed with no glitch into ongoing motor/head audio when the drive is active.

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

The following items were considered and explicitly deferred. They MAY become follow-up features but are not delivered by this spec:

1. **Sample sourcing decision (recording, synthesis, third-party samples)** — explicitly an implementation-time choice. Real-hardware recordings under permissive licenses are preferred (NFR-005); procedural synthesis is an acceptable fallback. The spec accommodates any of: bundled self-recorded WAV samples, bundled CC0/CC-BY samples, or procedurally-synthesized waveforms generated inside `DiskIIAudioSource` at startup.
2. **Recording real Disk II hardware** — its own off-codebase task. Not blocking for landing the audio plumbing.
3. **Procedural synthesis design** — if the implementer chooses procedural synthesis, the detailed DSP design (sawtooth fundamentals, resonator filters, envelope shapes) is not specified here; it is an implementation detail bounded by FR-001..FR-005, FR-013, FR-014, and FR-009.
4. **Concrete sample sets for non-Disk-II drives** — //c internal 5.25, DuoDisk, Apple 5.25 Drive (A9M0107), Apple /// drive, ProFile / hard disks, Smartport / UniDisk 3.5, RAM disks. Their **plumbing** is in scope (FR-015, FR-016 — the abstraction MUST support them); their **specific sample sets, synthesis, and per-drive-type sink wiring** are left to follow-up features.
5. **Per-drive volume / pan controls in UI** — pan defaults are wired (FR-012) but no UI exposes per-drive adjustment in v1. A single global on/off is the only user-facing knob.
6. **Save-state of audio state** — Casso has no save-state subsystem; not applicable.
7. **Recording or exporting drive audio to a file** — playback only.
8. **Persisting the Drive Audio toggle across launches** — v1 may default-on every launch; if a persistence mechanism exists (or is added by another feature), the toggle SHOULD respect it, but adding persistence is out of scope here.

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: The WASAPI mix format is float32 PCM at the device's native sample rate (commonly 44100 or 48000 Hz, occasionally higher), discoverable after `WasapiAudio::Initialize()`. The pipeline runs at the device's native rate; speaker output is **not** resampled (preserving FR-011 / SC-006 bit-identity with prior behavior). Drive-audio sample assets are resampled **once at load time** (via `IMFSourceReader`'s target-rate output) to match the device rate, so the runtime mixer never has to deal with rate mismatch. Stereo is required on every host Casso currently targets; the pipeline gracefully downmixes to mono if the device is mono.
- **A-002**: `DiskIIController::HandlePhase()` correctly computes `qtDelta` and clamps `m_quarterTrack` to the `[0, kMaxQuarterTrack]` range. The bump-detection FR (FR-004) relies on this invariant, which is already enforced (see `CassoEmuCore/Devices/DiskIIController.cpp:229-294` per research §6).
- **A-003**: The drive audio subsystem is only active when at least one drive controller (Disk II in v1) is present in the machine configuration. Profiles without drive controllers (e.g., a cassette-only Apple ][) bypass drive-audio wiring entirely (FR-015).
- **A-004**: All drive-audio state runs on the CPU emulation thread (the same one that calls `ExecuteCpuSlices()`), per NFR-002. This eliminates lock/atomic requirements for v1.
- **A-005**: A View → Options... dialog either exists or is created as part of this feature. The existing View menu accepts a new "Options..." entry without architectural change (confirmed by `Casso/MenuSystem.{h,cpp}` pre-touch).
- **A-006**: The disk mount/eject code path in the shell (or wherever a `DiskIIController` learns about a disk image swap) can be extended with a single notification call into the drive's `IDriveAudioSink` without disturbing existing disk-image semantics.

## Glossary

- **Quarter-track** — The Disk II head positioning unit. A full track is 4 quarter-tracks; the full 35-track surface is 140 quarter-track positions (0..139). The head can be parked between physical tracks (half-track or quarter-track copy protection schemes exploit this).
- **Phase (Disk II)** — One of four electromagnets ($C0E0..$C0E7 in pairs of on/off) that pull the head stepper. Energizing the next phase in sequence moves the head one quarter-track; energizing a phase 180° opposed pulls it the other way.
- **`qtDelta`** — The signed quarter-track displacement that `HandlePhase()` computes from the current and target phase. `qtDelta == 0` means no head movement; `qtDelta != 0` is the audio-trigger condition for FR-003.
- **Bump / track-0 stop** — Mechanical limit at quarter-track 0 (and 139). RWTS recalibration intentionally walks the head past the stop to force a known position; the head physically can't move, but the stepper still energizes, producing the audible "thunk."
- **Spindown** — The ~1-second timer (`kMotorSpindownCycles = 1,000,000` cycles at 1.023 MHz) between the last `$C0E8` motor-off and the actual `m_motorOn = false` transition. Exists to avoid stop/start churn during multi-sector reads.
- **Seek vs. step** — A "step" is a single quarter-track movement; a "seek" is a contiguous sequence of steps to relocate the head. Audibly, a step is a click; a seek is a buzz. The ~16 ms inter-step threshold (FR-005) discriminates them.
- **WASAPI** — Windows Audio Session API; the host audio path Casso submits float PCM to. The mixing point for this feature is `WasapiAudio::SubmitFrame()`.
- **`DriveAudioMixer`** — The new class (`CassoEmuCore/Audio/DriveAudioMixer.{h,cpp}`) introduced by this feature that owns registered audio sources and produces per-frame stereo drive PCM.
- **`IDriveAudioSink`** — Abstract notification interface from a drive controller to its `IDriveAudioSource`. Six methods: `OnMotorStart`, `OnMotorStop`, `OnHeadStep(int newQt)`, `OnHeadBump()`, `OnDiskInserted()`, `OnDiskEjected()`.
- **`IDriveAudioSource`** — Abstract per-drive audio source (`CassoEmuCore/Audio/IDriveAudioSource.h`) implementing `IDriveAudioSink` and producing stereo PCM on demand. Concrete in v1: `DiskIIAudioSource`.
- **Pan / stereo placement** — Equal-power (constant-loudness) panning: each source has L/R gain coefficients with `panL² + panR² = 1.0`. Drive 1 defaults left-biased (θ ≈ 3π/8), Drive 2 right-biased (θ ≈ π/8); a single registered drive plays centered (`panL = panR = √0.5`). See FR-012.
