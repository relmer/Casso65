# Specification Quality Checklist: Apple II Platform Emulator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-07-22
**Updated**: 2025-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec is comprehensive with 7 prioritized user stories covering the full incremental build order.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the user's feature description was exceptionally detailed with all key design decisions pre-made.
- Technical Apple II hardware details (memory addresses, interleaved layout, NTSC artifacting) are included as domain-specific behavioral requirements, not implementation details — they describe *what* the system must do, not *how* to code it.
- The spec references specific Win32/GDI and C++ constraints in the Assumptions section because these are project-level constraints from the constitution, not implementation choices made in this spec.

### Post-Review Updates (2025-07-22)

The following gaps were identified during review and addressed:

1. **CPU-MemoryBus integration** (FR-020): Added explanation of how the existing `Cpu` class connects to the MemoryBus via subclassing and virtual method override. Added new "CPU Integration with CassoCore" section.
2. **65C02 support** (FR-021): Added requirement for 65C02 opcode extension for Apple IIe support.
3. **Apple II original config** (FR-026): Added Apple II (original/Integer BASIC) as a supported machine with its own config. Added "Apple II Model Differences" section with comparison tables.
4. **GUI specification** (FR-022): Added window spec, menu bar, keyboard shortcuts, title bar format. Added "GUI Application Structure" section.
5. **Emulation loop** (FR-023): Added frame-based execution architecture, timing calculations, and speed synchronization. Added "Emulation Loop Architecture" section.
6. **Audio API** (FR-024): Specified waveOut API and buffer strategy for speaker toggle audio generation.
7. **Slot device mapping** (FR-025): Added "Slot-Based Device Mapping" section explaining how slot numbers translate to I/O and ROM address ranges.
8. **Edge cases**: Added undefined opcode behavior and floating bus behavior for unmapped I/O.
9. **Key Entities**: Added `EmuCpu` and `EmulatorShell` entities.
10. **Success Criteria**: Added SC-011 (menu-driven disk/reset/pause) and SC-012 (Apple II original boot).
