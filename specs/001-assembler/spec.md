# Feature Specification: 6502 Assembler

**Feature Branch**: `001-assembler`  
**Created**: 2026-04-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A two-pass 6502 assembler class that converts assembly language source text into machine code bytes"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Assemble Simple Instructions (Priority: P1)

A developer writes a short assembly snippet containing basic instructions (e.g., LDA, STA, ADC) with immediate, zero-page, and absolute addressing modes. The assembler converts this into the correct machine code bytes, and the developer can load those bytes into the emulator's memory for execution.

**Why this priority**: Without correct opcode resolution for the core instruction set, no other assembler feature is useful. This is the foundation — the assembler must correctly turn mnemonics + addressing modes into opcode bytes using the existing instruction table.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assembling a handful of instructions, comparing emitted bytes against known-good opcodes, and verifying the output length matches expectations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** assembly text `LDA #$42`, **When** assembled, **Then** the output contains the correct opcode byte for LDA immediate followed by `$42`
2. **Given** assembly text with zero-page addressing `STA $10`, **When** assembled, **Then** the output contains the correct opcode byte for STA zero-page followed by `$10`
3. **Given** assembly text with absolute addressing `JMP $1234`, **When** assembled, **Then** the output contains the correct opcode for JMP absolute followed by `$34, $12` (little-endian)
4. **Given** assembly text with accumulator addressing `ROL A`, **When** assembled, **Then** the output contains only the single-byte ROL accumulator opcode
5. **Given** assembly text with all indexed modes (e.g., `LDA $10,X`, `LDA ($10,X)`, `LDA ($10),Y`, `LDA $1234,X`, `LDA $1234,Y`), **When** assembled, **Then** each produces the correct distinct opcode for that addressing mode

---

### User Story 2 - Labels and Branching (Priority: P1)

A developer writes assembly code with named labels and branch instructions that reference those labels. The assembler resolves label addresses during a second pass and produces correct relative offsets for branch instructions and absolute addresses for JMP/JSR targets.

**Why this priority**: Labels are essential for writing any non-trivial assembly program. Without them, the developer must manually compute addresses and offsets, making the assembler impractical for real use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assembling code with forward and backward label references, then verifying that branch offsets and jump targets resolve to the correct addresses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** assembly with a forward label reference (`BEQ target` ... `target: NOP`), **When** assembled, **Then** the branch offset correctly points to the label's address
2. **Given** assembly with a backward label reference (`loop: INX` ... `BNE loop`), **When** assembled, **Then** the branch offset correctly points back to the label
3. **Given** assembly with `JMP label` where the label is an absolute address, **When** assembled, **Then** the two-byte operand contains the label's address in little-endian
4. **Given** assembly with `JSR subroutine` referencing a labeled subroutine, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand is the subroutine's absolute address
5. **Given** a duplicate label name, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported identifying the duplicate and its line number
6. **Given** a branch instruction referencing an undefined label, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported identifying the undefined label and its line number

---

### User Story 3 - Directives for Data and Origin (Priority: P2)

A developer uses assembler directives to control where code is placed in memory and to embed raw data (bytes, 16-bit words, ASCII strings) in the output. This allows setting up data tables, string constants, and placing code at specific addresses.

**Why this priority**: Directives are needed to write realistic test programs that place code at known addresses and include lookup tables or string data. Without `.org`, all code starts at a default address, limiting test flexibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assembling programs that use each directive, then verifying the output bytes appear at the expected offsets and contain the correct values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `.org $C000` followed by `NOP`, **When** assembled, **Then** the NOP opcode is placed at address `$C000` in the output
2. **Given** `.byte $FF, $00, $42`, **When** assembled, **Then** three bytes `$FF, $00, $42` are emitted in order
3. **Given** `.word $1234, $ABCD`, **When** assembled, **Then** four bytes `$34, $12, $CD, $AB` are emitted (little-endian)
4. **Given** `.text "Hello"`, **When** assembled, **Then** five bytes corresponding to the ASCII values of `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o` are emitted
5. **Given** a label followed by `.byte` data, **When** another instruction references that label, **Then** the label resolves to the address where the data begins

---

### User Story 4 - Number Formats and Simple Expressions (Priority: P2)

A developer uses hexadecimal, binary, and decimal number literals in operands, and uses simple label expressions (`label+offset`, `<label` for low byte, `>label` for high byte) to compute operand values from label addresses.

**Why this priority**: Multiple number formats are standard assembler syntax; low/high byte operators are essential for loading 16-bit addresses into 8-bit registers, a very common 6502 pattern.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assembling instructions that use each number format and expression type, then verifying the emitted operand bytes are correct.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `LDA #$FF`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand byte is `$FF`
2. **Given** `LDA #%10101010`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand byte is `$AA`
3. **Given** `LDA #255`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand byte is `$FF`
4. **Given** a label `data` at address `$1234` and instruction `LDA #<data`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand byte is `$34` (low byte of address)
5. **Given** a label `data` at address `$1234` and instruction `LDA #>data`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand byte is `$12` (high byte of address)
6. **Given** a label `table` at address `$2000` and instruction `LDA table+3`, **When** assembled, **Then** the operand address is `$2003`

---

### User Story 5 - Comments and Whitespace Handling (Priority: P3)

A developer writes assembly code with semicolon-delimited comments (full-line and inline) and varied whitespace. The assembler ignores comments and handles whitespace gracefully.

**Why this priority**: Comments and flexible formatting are basic quality-of-life features. They don't affect output but are needed for readable test programs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assembling commented code and verifying the output is identical to the same code without comments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a full-line comment `; this is a comment`, **When** assembled, **Then** no bytes are emitted for that line
2. **Given** an inline comment `LDA #$42 ; load value`, **When** assembled, **Then** the instruction assembles correctly and the comment is ignored
3. **Given** blank lines interspersed in the source, **When** assembled, **Then** blank lines are ignored and surrounding instructions assemble correctly
4. **Given** varying indentation and spacing around operands, **When** assembled, **Then** the instructions assemble correctly

---

### User Story 6 - Assemble-and-Run Integration in Tests (Priority: P1)

A test developer uses a convenience method on TestCpu to assemble source text directly into emulator memory, execute it, and verify the CPU state afterward. This eliminates the need to hand-code raw opcode bytes in test cases.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary consumer of the assembler — making unit tests dramatically more readable and maintainable. Without this integration, the assembler provides value only in isolation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing a test that assembles a short program, runs it, and asserts register values, memory contents, and flag states.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** assembly source text and a TestCpu instance, **When** `Assemble(source)` is called, **Then** the assembled bytes are written into the CPU's memory starting at the current PC
2. **Given** a successfully assembled program, **When** `RunUntil(address)` is called, **Then** the CPU executes instructions until PC reaches the target address
3. **Given** `RunUntil(address)` is called, **When** the CPU executes more than the configured maximum iterations without reaching the target, **Then** execution stops and an indication of the timeout is available
4. **Given** a successfully assembled program with labels, **When** `LabelAddress(name)` is called, **Then** the address of the named label is returned
5. **Given** assembly source with errors, **When** `Assemble(source)` is called, **Then** the errors are accessible and no partial code is written to memory

---

### User Story 7 - Error Reporting (Priority: P2)

When assembly source contains errors (invalid mnemonics, bad addressing mode syntax, out-of-range values, undefined labels, duplicate labels), the assembler collects all errors with line numbers and makes them available to the caller rather than stopping at the first error.

**Why this priority**: Good error reporting is critical for usability. Collecting all errors (rather than halting on the first) lets the developer fix multiple issues in one pass.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by feeding intentionally malformed assembly text and verifying each error message includes the correct line number and a meaningful description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invalid mnemonic `XYZ`, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported with the line number and an indication that the mnemonic is unrecognized
2. **Given** `LDA` with no operand, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported indicating a missing operand
3. **Given** `BEQ undefinedLabel`, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported identifying the undefined label
4. **Given** a branch instruction whose target is more than 127 bytes away, **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported indicating the branch target is out of range
5. **Given** source with multiple errors on different lines, **When** assembled, **Then** all errors are collected (not just the first) and each includes its respective line number
6. **Given** `LDA #$1FF` (value exceeds byte range for immediate mode), **When** assembled, **Then** an error is reported indicating the value is out of range

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when source text is empty? The assembler succeeds with zero output bytes and no errors.
- What happens when `.org` sets an address lower than the current output position? The assembler reports an error (cannot move origin backward within a contiguous block).
- What happens when a label name collides with a mnemonic (e.g., a label named `LDA`)? The assembler reports an error — label names must not be reserved mnemonics.
- What happens when a branch offset is exactly at the boundary (±127/128 bytes)? Offsets of -128 to +127 are valid; ±128 on the positive side is out of range.
- What happens when `.text` contains an empty string (`""`)? Zero bytes are emitted; this is not an error.
- What happens when addressing mode syntax is ambiguous (e.g., `STA $10` could be zero-page or absolute)? The assembler prefers the shorter encoding (zero-page) when the address fits in one byte.

---

### User Story 8 - Command-Line Interface (Priority: P1)

A developer uses the My6502 executable from the command line to assemble source files to binary output and/or run programs directly. The CLI uses subcommands modeled after ACME (the popular 6502 assembler).

**Why this priority**: The CLI is the primary non-test entry point for the assembler. Without it, assembly is only available programmatically.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by running the executable with various argument combinations and checking exit codes, output files, and stderr messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `My6502 assemble input.asm -o output.bin`, **When** run, **Then** the input file is assembled and the binary output is written to the specified file
2. **Given** `My6502 assemble input.asm -o output.bin -l labels.txt`, **When** run, **Then** a symbol table file is also written with label names and addresses
3. **Given** `My6502 run input.asm`, **When** run, **Then** the file is assembled and executed immediately
4. **Given** `My6502 run output.bin --load $8000`, **When** run, **Then** the binary is loaded at the specified address and executed
5. **Given** assembly errors in the input file, **When** `My6502 assemble` is run, **Then** errors are printed to stderr with line numbers and the process exits with a non-zero code
6. **Given** `My6502` with no arguments, **When** run, **Then** a usage summary is displayed
7. **Given** `My6502 --version`, **When** run, **Then** the version string is displayed

---

### User Story 9 - Listing File Output (Priority: P1)

A developer requests a listing file that shows each source line alongside its assembled address and machine code bytes. This is essential for debugging assembly programs and verifying the assembler's output.

**Why this priority**: Listing files are a critical debugging tool — they show exactly what bytes were generated at what addresses, making it easy to spot encoding errors or incorrect label resolution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by assembling a program with listing enabled and verifying the listing contains the correct address, bytes, and source text for each line.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the `-a` flag on the CLI (or a listing option in the API), **When** a program is assembled, **Then** a listing is produced showing address, hex bytes, and original source per line
2. **Given** a line with an instruction, **Then** the listing shows the address (e.g., `$8000`), the hex bytes (e.g., `A9 42`), and the source (`LDA #$42`)
3. **Given** a comment-only or blank line, **Then** the listing shows the source text with no address or bytes
4. **Given** a `.byte` directive, **Then** the listing shows the address and the emitted data bytes
5. **Given** a label-only line, **Then** the listing shows the address the label resolves to
6. **Given** a `.org` directive, **Then** the listing shows the new origin address

---

### User Story 10 - Verbose Output and Warning Control (Priority: P2)

A developer uses verbose mode to see detailed assembly progress and controls whether warnings are displayed, elevated to errors, or suppressed.

**Why this priority**: Verbose output aids debugging during development. Warning control lets the developer decide how strictly to treat edge cases (e.g., unused labels, redundant `.org`).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by assembling with different verbosity/warning flags and verifying the expected messages appear or are suppressed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the `-v` (verbose) flag, **When** assembling, **Then** pass progress, symbol resolution details, and byte counts are printed to stderr
2. **Given** no `-v` flag, **When** assembling, **Then** only errors and warnings are printed (quiet by default)
3. **Given** `--warn` (default), **When** a warning condition occurs, **Then** the warning is printed to stderr but assembly succeeds
4. **Given** `--fatal-warnings`, **When** a warning condition occurs, **Then** it is treated as an error and assembly fails
5. **Given** `--no-warn`, **When** a warning condition occurs, **Then** the warning is suppressed

- **Assembled Output**: A sequence of bytes with an associated starting address, produced by the assembler
- **Error List**: A collection of error entries, each containing a line number and descriptive message
- **Instruction Table**: The existing 256-entry opcode lookup table, used in reverse to map (mnemonic + addressing mode) to opcode byte

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-005**: Assembled programs execute identically to the same programs loaded as raw bytes via `WriteBytes()`
- **SC-006**: The assembler handles all edge cases (empty input, boundary branch offsets, mixed number formats) without crashes or undefined behavior
- **SC-007**: The CLI `assemble` subcommand produces byte-identical output to programmatic `Assembler::Assemble()` for the same input
- **SC-008**: Listing output correctly shows address, hex bytes, and source text for every line type (instructions, directives, labels, comments)

## Scope Boundary

### Out of Scope

- Macros and macro expansion
- Conditional assembly directives (`#if`, `.ifdef`, `.ifndef`)
- Relocatable output or linking multiple object files
- Include files or file I/O in the assembler core — the assembler takes a string; file reading is done by the CLI layer
- Illegal/undocumented 6502 opcodes
- Command-line symbol definition (`-Dlabel=value`) — future enhancement
- CPU variant selection (`--cpu 65c02`) — future enhancement when 65C02 extensions are added to the emulator

## Assumptions

- The existing 256-entry instruction table is complete and correct for all legal 6502 opcodes
- Mnemonic names in the instruction table are consistent uppercase strings (e.g., `"LDA"`, `"STA"`)
- The assembler will be used primarily in test code and the interactive console, not for assembling large programs (performance is not a primary concern)
- The default origin address when no `.org` directive is given is the TestCpu default start PC (`$8000`)
- Assembly source uses standard 6502 syntax conventions (operand follows mnemonic, separated by whitespace)
- The `label+offset` expression supports only addition of a positive integer constant; subtraction and complex arithmetic are not needed
