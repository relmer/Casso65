#  HgrPreprocess.py — convert a source image into an Apple //e HGR framebuffer
#
#  Reads an arbitrary RGB image (typically one of the cassowary photos under
#  Assets/), crops to the desired subject region, fits it into 280x192 with
#  optional letterbox padding for portrait subjects, color-quantizes to
#  Apple ][ HGR's per-byte palette pairs (white/black plus violet+green or
#  blue+orange depending on each byte's high bit), and emits the 8192-byte
#  HGR page-1 framebuffer as raw bytes.
#
#  HGR memory layout (Apple //e, page 1 at $2000):
#    addr = $2000
#         + 1024 * (row & 7)
#         + 128  * ((row >> 3) & 7)
#         +  40  * (row >> 6)
#  Each byte stores 7 horizontal pixels in bits 0..6 (LSB = leftmost).
#  Bit 7 picks the color palette pair: 0 = violet+green, 1 = blue+orange.
#  Within a byte, even-bit pixels (0,2,4,6) take the "phase A" color
#  (violet or blue), odd-bit pixels (1,3,5) take the "phase B" color
#  (green or orange). Two adjacent ON pixels appear as white due to NTSC
#  composite artifacting, two adjacent OFF pixels appear as black.
#
#  Determinism: PIL.Image.resize with a fixed resampling filter and our
#  own pure-python quantizer are deterministic across Pillow >= 9 on the
#  same input bytes, so re-running the script reproduces the same output.
