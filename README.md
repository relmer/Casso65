## What's New

A few major capability waves landed between v1.3.509 and v1.3.696. Headlines below; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the granular history.

### Disk II audio (v1.3.696)

Realistic mechanical sounds during disk activity, mixed into the WASAPI pipeline alongside the //e speaker:

- Stereo motor hum, head-step clicks, track-0 / max-track bumps, and disk insert / eject sounds.
- Per-drive equal-power stereo panning: single-drive profiles play centered; in two-drive profiles Drive 1 leans left, Drive 2 leans right.
- Step-vs-seek discrimination: contiguous step bursts during DOS RWTS recalibration fuse into a continuous seek buzz instead of N overlapping clicks.
- *View → Options...* dialog with a Drive Audio toggle (default on) and a Disk II mechanism dropdown (Shugart SA400 by default, or Alps 2124A). Both persist per-machine via the registry.
- First-run consent dialog downloads the actual recordings from the [OpenEmulator](https://github.com/openemulator/libemulation) project; OGGs are decoded in memory via vendored `stb_vorbis` and written as WAV (no `.ogg` retained on disk). Asked once per machine, persisted thereafter.
- Generic `IDriveAudioSink` / `IDriveAudioSource` / `DriveAudioMixer` abstraction so future drive types (//c internal 5.25, DuoDisk, Apple 5.25 Drive, ProFile, ...) plug in without touching the mixer.

### Friendly first-run bootstrap (v1.3.573)

Drop `Casso.exe` anywhere, double-click, and the rest happens:

- **Missing ROMs?** Casso lists what's needed and offers to download them from the AppleWin project in one click.
- **First time on the Apple //e?** Casso offers to download a stock Apple system master disk (DOS 3.3 or ProDOS) from the Asimov archive so the //e boots straight to a BASIC prompt instead of spinning forever waiting for a disk.
- **Lost your Machines/ folder?** The three default machine configs (`Apple ][`, `Apple ][+`, `Apple //e`) are bundled inside `Casso.exe` and extracted on demand.
- **Moved your install?** Per-machine remembered disks are stored as paths relative to `Casso.exe`, so the whole `Casso.exe` + `Disks/` tree is portable.

### Apple //e fidelity (v1.3.509)

Casso became a real Apple //e — not just a 6502 host that draws text:

- Cold boot to BASIC with audit-correct Language Card state machine, 64 KB auxiliary RAM, and the //e MMU (`INTCXROM` / `SLOTC3ROM` / `INTC8ROM` / `STORE80` / `RAMRD` / `RAMWRT` and the `ALTZP`-driven page-0/1 swap).
- 80-column text mode + Double Hi-Res with NTSC artifact colors.
- Cycle-accurate IRQ / NMI dispatch, soft reset vs. power cycle distinction, `RDVBLBAR` ($C019) wired into the video timing model.
- Disk II controller with full DOS 3.3 / ProDOS / WOZ v1 + v2 support, `.dsk` / `.do` / `.po` nibblization, and auto-flush on eject so user writes survive.
- Headless test harness (`HeadlessHost`) for deterministic integration tests of cold boot, disk boot, framebuffer hashing, and reset semantics.

## About

Casso is a retro / classic-machine platform emulator and from-scratch AS65-compatible 6502 assembler, written in C++. Today the platform emulator targets the Apple II family (][, ][+, //e); the abstractions are generic enough to host other 6502-based machines later.

The project includes:

- **Apple II platform emulator** — GUI-based Apple II, II+, and //e emulator with D3D11 rendering, WASAPI audio, Disk II controller with realistic mechanical sounds, data-driven machine configs, 80-column text + Double Hi-Res, auxiliary RAM, audit-correct Language Card state machine, and cycle-accurate IRQ/NMI infrastructure.
- **6502 CPU emulator** — passes [Klaus Dormann's functional test suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests) and all 151 legal-opcode sets from [Tom Harte's SingleStepTests](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/ProcessorTests) (10,000 vectors each).
- **AS65-compatible assembler** — a from-scratch reimplementation of Frank A. Kingswood's AS65, intended as a drop-in replacement. Supports the complete AS65 syntax: macros, conditional assembly (`if`/`ifdef`/`ifndef`/`else`/`endif`), the full expression evaluator (arithmetic, bitwise, logical, shift, `<`/`>` byte selectors, current-PC `*`), `equ`/`=` constants, `include`, three-segment model (`code`/`data`/`bss`), AS65-style listing output, and AS65 command-line flags (`-l`, `-t`, `-s`, `-s2`, `-z`, `-c`, `-w`, `-d`, `-g`, ...) including flag concatenation (`-tlfile`).
- **CLI tool** — runs as an AS65-style assembler by default, or with the `run` subcommand to load and execute a binary or assembly source.
- **First-run asset bootstrap** — Casso fetches the ROMs, sample disks, and Disk II audio samples it needs on first launch (with user consent), so a fresh `Casso.exe` boots to a usable //e BASIC prompt with no manual setup.
- **Headless test harness** — `HeadlessHost` drives the emulator with no Win32 window, enabling deterministic integration tests for cold boot, disk boot, video framebuffer hashing, and reset semantics.
- **1100+ unit tests** — comprehensive coverage of CPU instruction encoding, addressing modes, arithmetic, branching, assembler features, audio pipeline (speaker + drive), //e MMU + Language Card, video timing, Disk II nibble engine, WOZ + nibblized image formats, 80-col + DHR video, reset semantics, perf budget, and backwards-compat for ][/][+ machines.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) for build/test scripts
- Visual Studio 2026 (v18.x)
  - Workload: **Desktop development with C++**
  - Components: MSVC build tools, Windows SDK, C++ unit test framework
  - Optional: MSVC ARM64 build tools (for ARM64 builds)
- Optional: VS Code (repo includes `.vscode/` tasks)

## Quick Start

### Build

```powershell
# Build Debug for current architecture (Ctrl+Shift+B in VS Code)
.\scripts\Build.ps1

# Build Release
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Configuration Release

# Build all platforms
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Target BuildAllRelease

# Rebuild with code analysis (warnings as errors)
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Configuration Release -RunCodeAnalysis
```

### Test

```powershell
# Build and run tests
.\scripts\RunTests.ps1

# Or use VS Code: Run Tests (current arch)
```

### Assemble and Run

```powershell
# Assemble a source file to a flat binary (AS65 mode — no subcommand)
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe input.a65 -o output.bin

# Assemble with a listing file and a symbol table
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe input.a65 -o output.bin -l listing.txt -t

# Output Motorola S-record (.s19) or Intel HEX (.hex)
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe input.a65 -s   -o output.s19
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe input.a65 -s2  -o output.hex

# Pre-define a symbol on the command line, generate cycle counts in the listing
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe input.a65 -d DEBUG=1 -cl listing.txt

# Assemble and run an assembly source directly
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe run input.a65

# Load and run a pre-assembled binary at a specific address
.\x64\Debug\CassoCli.exe run output.bin --load $8000
```

### Apple II Emulator

The emulator requires Apple II ROM images, which are copyrighted by Apple and not
distributed with this project. A script is included to download them from the
[AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin) project:

```powershell
# Download ROM images into the per-machine Machines/<Name>/ folders
.\scripts\FetchRoms.ps1

# Run the emulator (defaults to Apple II+)
.\ARM64\Debug\Casso.exe

# Run with a specific machine config
.\ARM64\Debug\Casso.exe --machine Apple2e
```

ROM images live under `Machines/<MachineName>/` (e.g.,
`Machines/Apple2e/Apple2e.rom`) and shared device boot ROMs live
under `Devices/<Family>/` (e.g., `Devices/DiskII/Disk2.rom`). Both
`Machines/` and `Devices/` are fully runtime-managed: every file
inside is either extracted from binary-embedded resources or
downloaded on first launch (with user consent). Delete either
directory and the next launch rebuilds it from scratch.

Available machine configs are in `Machines/<MachineName>/<MachineName>.json`.

## Why "Casso"?

The 6502 emulator world already has too many projects named [Emu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu), so I decided to be a little different. I picked its larger, flightless, slightly-more-dangerous cousin: the [cassowary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary)—Casso to his friends. I want this to be a great emulator and a great assembler, but don't take things too seriously.

I thus present to you our regal namesake—revel in his splendor!

## Acknowledgments

Casso's correctness is validated against two exceptional open-source test suites:

- **[Klaus Dormann's 6502 Functional Test Suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)** — [@Klaus2m5](https://github.com/Klaus2m5)'s exhaustive functional test exercises every documented 6502 behavior: all instructions, addressing modes, flag interactions, BCD arithmetic, and edge cases. Casso passes the full suite.
- **[Tom Harte's SingleStepTests](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/ProcessorTests)** — [@TomHarte](https://github.com/TomHarte)'s per-opcode test vectors validate every legal 6502 opcode against cycle-accurate reference traces. Casso passes all 151 legal-opcode test sets (10,000 vectors each).

Thank you to both authors for making these invaluable resources freely available. They are the gold standard for 6502 emulator validation.
