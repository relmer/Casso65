Entries before versioning was introduced use dates only.

## [1.2.315] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Character generator ROM loading** — text mode renderers now load the real
  Apple character ROM file (`apple2-video.rom` for II/II+, `apple2e-enhanced-video.rom`
  for the //e) instead of the embedded 96-character fallback. Fixes:
  - **//e cursor** is now visible (the cursor character was outside our embedded
    range)
  - **//e boot logo** "Apple ][" displays fully (the missing characters were also
    outside our embedded range)
  - All 256 character codes render correctly across inverse, flash, and normal regions
- **CharacterRomData** loader (`CassoEmuCore/Video/CharacterRomData.h/.cpp`)
  decodes both 2KB (II/II+) and 4KB (//e enhanced) ROM formats including the
  bit-reversed 2KB layout and the //e's primary + alt char set arrangement.
  Falls back to embedded $20-$5F glyphs if no ROM file is configured.

## [1.1.311] — 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Machine config schema v2** — breaking change. Refactored from a single `memory[]`
  array with conditional fields into clear sections:
  - `ram[]` — RAM regions with `address` + `size` (and optional `bank`)
  - `systemRom` — singular system ROM (`address` + `file`; size derived from file)
  - `characterRom` — character generator ROM (file only)
  - `internalDevices[]` — motherboard I/O (just `type`)
  - `slots[]` — expansion cards (`slot`, optional `device`, optional `rom`)
  All three machine configs (`apple2.json`, `apple2plus.json`, `apple2e.json`)
  migrated to the new schema.
- **ROM size validation** — system ROM file size now determines the end address
  automatically (no more start/end mismatch bugs)
- **Slot ROM auto-mapping** — slot ROMs auto-map to `$C000 + slot * 0x100`,
  required to be exactly 256 bytes

### Added
- **FetchRoms.ps1** — expanded to download all peripheral card ROMs from AppleWin:
  Disk II 13-sector, Mockingboard, Mouse Interface, Parallel printer, Super Serial
  Card, ThunderClock Plus, HDC SmartPort, Hard Disk drivers, Apple //e Enhanced
  system ROM
- **Apple //e Disk II slot ROM** — `disk2.rom` now loads at $C600-$C6FF (slot 6)
  via the new schema, satisfying the //e autostart scan

## [1.0.307] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Machine picker dialog** — modal Win32 ListView showing all `Machines/*.json` configs
  with display names from the JSON `name` field; shown at startup if no last-used
  machine, when clicking the status bar Machine panel, or via File > Switch Machine
- **Last-used machine persistence** — stored in registry at `HKCU\Software\relmer\Casso`
- **Hot-swap machine switching** — pause CPU, tear down devices/bus/cpu/video,
  reload config, reinitialize, resume — works from menu, status bar, or startup
- **Random RAM on cold boot** — RAM ($0000-$BFFF) initialized with random values to
  match real DRAM power-on behavior (Apple II shows random characters at boot)
- **80STORE soft switch tracking** — IIe keyboard intercepts $C000/$C001 writes to
  track 80STORE state; video mode selection suppresses page2 when 80STORE is active
- **ROM size validation** — RomDevice rejects ROM files that don't match the configured
  address range size, with a clear error message
- **Illegal opcode handling** — CPU treats illegal opcodes as 1-byte NOPs (2 cycles)
  with a debug log message instead of crashing

### Fixed
- **//e boot** — corrected ROM start address from $C100 to $C000 (16KB ROM); slot ROM
  trimmed to $C100-$CFFF to avoid shadowing I/O space at $C000-$C0FF
- **Language Card state machine** — corrected read source decoding to use both bits 0
  and 1 (was using only bit 0); $C083 now correctly enables Read RAM + Write Enable
- **CpuOperations RMW operations** — Decrement, Increment, RotateLeft, RotateRight now
  use ReadByte/WriteByte instead of direct memory[] access, so they correctly route
  through the bus for I/O-mapped addresses
- **EmuCpu memory routing** — reads and writes for $C000+ now go through the
  MemoryBus, so the LanguageCardBank is consulted for $D000-$FFFF (was reading stale
  ROM from memory[] which caused //e BASIC to fail)
- **CreateMemoryDevices aux RAM handling** — RAM regions with a `bank` field (e.g.
  "aux") are skipped in main RAM creation; aux memory is handled by AuxRamCard
- **MemoryBus::Validate** — overlapping I/O devices are now warnings (logged via
  DEBUGMSG) instead of errors; first-match-wins is the correct hardware behavior

### Changed
- **Machine display names** — "Apple ][", "Apple ][ plus", "Apple //e"
- **File menu** — "Open Machine Config" renamed to "Switch Machine..." and ungrayed
- **Status bar** — clicking the Machine panel opens the picker dialog
- **Cpu::Reset** — removed all hardcoded test instructions and PC=$8000 setup;
  now just initializes registers/flags/memory
- **Cpu member initializers** — moved from constructor initializer list to in-class
  defaults
- **VS Code IntelliSense config** — added CassoEmuCore/Pch.h to forcedInclude so
  `<random>` and other STL headers resolve correctly

### Removed
- **Cpu::Run()** — dead code (never called); CLI uses its own StepOne loop

## [1.0.244] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Apple II platform emulator (Casso.exe)** — GUI-based Apple II, II+, and IIe emulator
  with D3D11 rendering, WASAPI audio, data-driven JSON machine configs, and keyboard input
- **CPU thread architecture** — dedicated CPU thread for 6502 execution and audio,
  UI thread for Win32 messages and D3D Present with vsync
- **Status bar** — shows CPU type, clock speed (MHz), machine name, and device count;
  clicking devices shows a popup listing all bus-mapped devices with address ranges
- **Edit menu** — Copy Text (reads 40×24 text screen as ASCII), Copy Screenshot
  (framebuffer as DIB bitmap), Paste (Ctrl+V feeds clipboard into keyboard)
- **Cycle-accurate instruction timing** — baseCycles in Microcode with runtime page-cross
  and branch-taken penalties
- **Pending audio buffer** — decouples PCM generation from WASAPI drain to prevent stutter
- **DPI-scaled debug console font** — uses GetDpiForWindow + MulDiv

### Changed
- **Project rename** — Casso65Core → CassoCore, Casso65EmuCore → CassoEmuCore,
  Casso65Emu → Casso, Casso65 → CassoCli; repo renamed to relmer/Casso
- **Exact NTSC timing** — CPU clock 1,022,727 Hz (was 1,023,000), cycles/frame 17,030
  (was 17,050); derived from 14.31818 MHz crystal
- **Speaker amplitude** — ±0.25f (was ±1.0f) to match reference audio levels
- **WASAPI buffer** — 100ms (was 33ms) for jitter headroom
- **D3D vsync** — Present(1) on UI thread, Present(0) was double-gating with frame timer
- **using namespace std** + **namespace fs** in both Emu Pch.h files
- **In-class member initialization** preferred over constructor initializer lists
- **Casso65Emu flattened** — removed Audio/, Shell/, Resources/, shaders/ subdirectories
- **machines/ → Machines/, roms/ → ROMs/** — directory casing standardized

### Fixed
- **Mixed-mode text flicker** — framebuffer race condition; CPU thread now copies completed
  framebuffer to UI buffer under mutex
- **Hi-res NTSC colors** — two-pass renderer correctly handles cross-byte-boundary adjacent
  pixels; HCOLOR=3 renders as solid white
- **Power cycle** — now clears RAM ($0000-$BFFF) for cold boot with APPLE ][ banner
- **Paste drops characters** — DrainPasteBuffer now checks keyboard strobe before feeding
  next character
- **Duplicate AddDevice** — every device was registered twice on the memory bus
- **Bus overlap detection** — Validate() uses CBRN with specific conflicting address ranges
- **Title bar garbage** — em-dash encoded as UTF-8 in source, replaced with \\u2014 escape
- **Debug console newlines** — bare LF converted to CRLF for Win32 EDIT control
- **Audio buzz during boot** — capped submission to one frame, pre-filled silence
- **Green screen** — CPU opcode fetch now uses virtual ReadByte through MemoryBus
- **Black screen** — D3D11 shaders implemented via runtime D3DCompile
- **ParseHexAddress** — overflow and invalid-char validation added
