Entries before versioning was introduced use dates only.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cycle-accurate instruction timing** — added `baseCycles` field to `Microcode` struct
  with canonical NMOS 6502 cycle counts for all 151 legal opcodes; `StepOne` now uses
  `baseCycles` directly instead of counting bus transactions, with runtime penalties for
  page-crossing (+1) and branch-taken (+1/+2); fixes ~30% cycle undercount that caused
  the CPU to run too fast and audio pitch to be too high

### Fixed
- **Audio buzz during boot** — WASAPI audio was filling the entire available buffer
  (up to 33 ms) with one frame's worth of speaker toggle data (16.67 ms), stretching
  timestamps and creating a sustained buzz; capped audio submission to one frame's
  worth of samples and pre-filled the initial buffer with silence
- **Bright green screen (CPU not executing ROM)** — `Cpu::StepOne` and `Cpu::Run`
  fetched opcodes via `memory[PC]` directly, bypassing `EmuCpu::ReadByte` override
  that routes through the MemoryBus; changed to call virtual `ReadByte(PC)` so the
  CPU correctly reads ROM and I/O through the bus
- **Debug console close kills emulator** — closing the debug console window (Ctrl+D)
  sent CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT which terminated the entire process; added a console control
  handler that intercepts the event and calls FreeConsole instead
- ROM search path bug: ROM files are now searched independently across all search paths,
  fixing failures when `machines/` and `roms/` are at different base directories
- **Black screen in Casso65Emu** — D3D11 shaders were never compiled, so the textured
  quad draw call was skipped and only the black clear color was displayed; implemented
  runtime shader compilation via D3DCompile

### Added
- `PathResolver` class in Casso65EmuCore — testable search-path logic for locating
  machine configs and ROM files
- `MemoryRegion::resolvedPath` — fully resolved ROM path stored after config loading
- Unit tests for `PathResolver` (BuildSearchPaths, FindFile) and `MachineConfigLoader`
  (Load, ROM resolution, error cases)
- **VideoRenderTests** — 7 new tests verifying all video renderers (text, lo-res, hi-res)
  work correctly with real memory pointers, not just nullptr; catches the green-screen bug
- **EmuCpu memory validation tests** — 6 new tests verifying GetMemory() non-null,
  PokeByte/WriteByte dual-sync to internal memory and bus, STA instruction end-to-end
  visibility to video renderers
- **AudioGenerator** — extracted PCM generation from `WasapiAudio::SubmitFrame` into a
  testable `AudioGenerator::GeneratePCM` static method in Casso65EmuCore
- **AudioTests** — 15 adversarial audio tests covering silence/DC, single toggle, square
  wave, rapid toggles, edge cases (zero cycles, zero samples), and speaker-to-PCM pipeline

  - All 56 mnemonics, all 14 addressing modes
  - Two-pass assembly with forward-reference resolution
  - Full expression evaluator: `+ - * / % & | ^ ~ << >>`, `<`/`>` byte selectors, current-PC `*`

  - Backslash line continuation in macros
  - Colon-less labels (AS65 compatibility)
  - Listing output: `-l [file]`, `-c` cycle counts, `-m` macro expansion, `-t` symbol table
  - Output formats: flat binary (default), `-s` Motorola S-record, `-s2` Intel HEX
  - Warning control: `--warn`, `--no-warn`, `--fatal-warnings`

### Fixed
- BCD flag behavior (N/V/Z flags match real 6502 hardware)
- JMP indirect page-boundary wrap bug
- JSR operand read overlapping stack push
- DEY/PLA opcode table swap
- STY missing source register in absolute mode
- Addressing mode wrapping for zero-page indexed modes
- Assembler: `equ` forward-reference chain resolution, `ifdef`/`ifndef`, `-s2` Intel HEX output, listing column layout, `.org` gap fill
- LDX/INC/DEC addressing mode table entries
